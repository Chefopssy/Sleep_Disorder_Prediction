Sleep Disorder Prediction

Description
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict sleep disorders based on lifestyle and health-related factors. The dataset used for this project is the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to classify individuals into different sleep disorder categories based on input features such as age, BMI, daily activities, and stress levels.

Dataset
The dataset is available on Kaggle: Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. The target variable for prediction is Sleep Disorder, which includes categories such as:
- Insomnia
- Sleep Apnea
- No Sleep Disorder

Model Development
The project follows these steps:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features that impact sleep disorders.
Model Training: Training different classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict sleep disorders.

Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using:
Confusion Matrix
Accuracy Score
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Results
The model successfully classifies individuals into different sleep disorder categories with a reasonable accuracy score. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.
